# jQuery-Animated-Square
jQuery animation using the animate() method 🟥

🔹 Syntax:
$(selector).animate({params}, speed, callback);

🔹 Breakdown of the sample animation:

🔸 I targeted a <div> as the selector I wanted to animate.

🔸 I applied the .animate() method to the <div> and defined the CSS properties to animate: height and width of the square.  Note: most of the CSS properties can be manipulated by writing them camel-cased e.g. paddingTop instead of padding-top.

🔸 I added the optional speed parameter to control how slow the animation executed.

🔸 It is possible to add a callback function to execute something after the animation completes.
  
🔹 Queues:
I wrote multiple .animate() methods that created a queue running different properties sequentially.
